Meaning of each Columns:
* GEO_ID: A unique geographic identifier for each ZIP code area. It includes a prefix (8600000US) with the actual ZIP code.
* ZCTA5: ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) code, created by the U.S. Census Bureau and are very similar to postal ZIP code areas.
* NAME: Repeats the ZIP code or ZCTA5 code.
* LSAD: Specifies the Legal/Statistical Area Description. Here, it's set to "ZCTA5".
* CENSUSAREA: The area of each ZIP code region.
* geometry: The geometric data, now it contains the centroid points of each ZIP code area, i.e., the arithmetic mean position of all the points in a polygon. Previously, it contained Polygon data, representing the boundary of each ZIP code area.

# Record start time
start_time = time.time()

# Initialize a list to store distances to the nearest hospital zip codes
distances = []

# Calculate the distance from each sample zip codes to the nearest zip codes with a hospital
for zip_code_geom in sample_zips_texas.geometry:
    # Find the nearest geometry in zips_withhospital_centroids
    nearest_geom = nearest_points(zip_code_geom, zips_withhospital_centroids.unary_union)[1]
    # Calculate distance to the nearest geometry
    distance = zip_code_geom.distance(nearest_geom)
    distances.append(distance)

# Record end time
end_time = time.time()

# Calculate time taken for the sample subset
sample_duration = end_time - start_time
print(f"Time taken for 10 zip codes: {sample_duration:.2f} seconds")

# Estimate the total time for the full dataset
estimated_time_full = (sample_duration / 10) * 1935
print(f"Estimated time: {estimated_time_full:.2f} seconds")
```

```{python}
# Record start time
start_time_full = time.time()

# Initialize a list to store distances
all_distances = []

# Calculate the distance from each sample zip codes to the nearest zip codes with a hospital
for zip_code_geom in zips_texas_centroids.geometry:
    # Find the nearest geometry in zips_withhospital_centroids
    nearest_geom = nearest_points(zip_code_geom, zips_withhospital_centroids.unary_union)[1]
    # Calculate distance to the nearest geometry
    distance = zip_code_geom.distance(nearest_geom)
    all_distances.append(distance)

end_time_full = time.time()

# Calculate time taken for the full dataset
actual_duration_full = end_time_full - start_time_full
print(f"Actual time: {actual_duration_full:.2f} seconds")
```

Answer:
* In my latest attempt (I try to run them simultaneously), the estimated time was 0.97 seconds, while the actual time was 0.66 seconds.
* The estimated time is slightly higher than the actual time, about 32% faster than the estimate. It could be due to factors like caching, resource usage or variability in processing time per zip codes.

```{python}
# Set path for .prj file
file_path_prj = r"C:/Users/Yuzi/Documents/GitHub/problem-set-4-allen/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k/gz_2010_us_860_00_500k.prj"

# Read the .prj file content as a WKT string
with open(file_path_prj, 'r') as f:
    prj_wkt = f.read()  # This line should be indented

# Create a CRS object from the WKT content
crs = CRS.from_wkt(prj_wkt)

# Print the CRS information
print("WKT Projection:", crs.to_wkt())
```

    Click into the .prj file, I find the code:
    ```
    GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",DATUM["D_North_American_1983",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]]
    ```
    Thus, the projection uses degrees as the unit of measurement.

    The approximate conversion I find is:
    * 1 degree ≈ 69 (or 69.4) miles
    * To convert the given unit to miles, we can multiply the result by 69 (or 69.4). ([Reference](https://www.sco.wisc.edu/2022/01/21/how-big-is-a-degree/))

5. 
It's in degrees as unit.
```{python}
# Calculate the average distance in degrees
average_distance_degrees = sum(all_distances) / len(all_distances)

# Convert the average distance from degrees to miles
average_distance_miles = average_distance_degrees * 69
print(f"Average distance in miles: {average_distance_miles:.2f} miles")
```

Answer:
* Yes, it make sense.
* Texas is the second-largest state in the U.S. by area, with many rural areas and a lower population density outside of major cities. This may lead to larger average distance.
* Rural zip codes may be much farther from the nearest hospital.

```{python}
# Convert each distance from degrees to miles
all_distances_miles = [distance * 69 for distance in all_distances]

# Make a copy of zips_texas_centroids
zips_texas_centroids_copy = zips_texas_centroids.copy()

# Add a new column for distances in miles
zips_texas_centroids_copy['Distance_to_Nearest_Hospital'] = all_distances_miles
```
```{python}
# Plot the map color-coded by the distance
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(12, 12))
zips_texas_centroids_copy.plot(column="Distance_to_Nearest_Hospital", 
                               cmap="Purples",

## Effects of closures on access in Texas (15 pts)

4. 

## Reflecting on the exercise (10 pts) 
2. (Partner 2) 
* a. In Section 2, We identify zip codes affected by closures by checking if the number of active hospitals decreases after a suspected closure. If the number of active hospitals remains the same or increases in the year following the closure, we flag the closure as a potential merger or acquisition, not an actual loss of access. After filtering out these suspected mergers, we are left with only closures likely to impact hospital access in those zip codes.
* b. This method of identifying closures by checking for "no decrease" in active hospitals has limitations and may not reliably distinguish between real closures and potential mergers or reclassifications: If the closure reflects only in the data for the same year, a real closure from 2017 to 2018 would show no change, while a false closure (like a merger or reclassification) might show an increase in 2018. This means that the "no decrease" criteria can be misleading, as it cannot accurately confirm the nature of the closure.
* c. Improvement: i. Track the number of active hospitals over multiple years, since a sustained decrease over several years would more likely indicate a true closure; ii. Consider the impact of hospitals in nearby zip codes, since residents may rely on hospitals in neighboring zip codes (spillover); iii. Cross-reference suspected closures with additional datasets or hospital registry information to identify cases of temporary closures or administrative changes, improving the accuracy.
